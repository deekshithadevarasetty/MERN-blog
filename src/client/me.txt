My name is Deekshu Devarasetty and I am a senior at Denmark High School.
I plan to go to Georgia Tech in the fall to major in Computer Science.
My biggest hobby is tennis; it is the way I stay sane throughout all the chaos.
I have chosen the online version of CS1331 because I am taking this course as a dual enrollment course.
